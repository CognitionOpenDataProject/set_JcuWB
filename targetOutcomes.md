For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section 2.3. Results. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> We found a significant interaction between picture construction condition and toy owner (F(2, 53) = 4.83, p = 0.01, View the MathML source). Specifically, following self-focus, children increased the value of their own toy (M = 0.95, 95% CI = [0.38, 1.52]) but not the experimenter’s toy (M = −0.07, 95% CI = [−0.74, 0.59], t(19) = 3.56, p = 0.01, d = 0.81, Bonferroni corrected). The opposite pattern of responses were observed in the other-focus condition, in which children valued the experimenter’s toy higher (M = 0.86, 95% CI = [0.20, 1.51]), but not their own toy (M = 0.17, 95% CI = [−0.39, 0.73]) - although this effect was not statistically significant (t(19) = −1.61, p = 0.36, d = 0.48, Bonferroni corrected). There was no significant effect of toy owner in the neutral-focus condition (Mchild = 0.89, 95% CIchild = [0.31, 1.46], Mexperimenter = 0.71, 95% CIexperimenter = [0.04, 1.38], t(19) = 0.48, p = 0.64, d = 0.13). The mean value change scores for each condition as a function of toy owner are presented in Fig. 2. We found no significant main effects of types of picture type (Mself = 0.44, 95% CIself = [−0.04, 0.91], Mother = 0.51, 95% CIother = [0.04, 0.98], Mneutral = 0.80, 95% CIneutral = [0.32, 1.28], F(2, 53) = 0.61, p = 0.55, View the MathML source) or toy owner (Mchild = 0.67, 95% CIchild = [0.34, 0.99], Mexperimenter = 0.50, 95% CIexperimenter = [0.12, 0.89], F(1, 53) = 0.55, p = 0.46, View the MathML source). A significant effect of age was observed (F(1, 53) = 7.68, p = 0.01, View the MathML source), indicating that older children increased their valuations more than younger children regardless of toy owner or picture condition. No significant effect of gender (F(1, 53) = 0.46, p = 0.50, View the MathML source), and no significant interactions involving gender or age were observed (Fs < 2.69, ps > 0.11, etc.).
